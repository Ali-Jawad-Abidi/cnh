48 hours without response oh boy. Sooo
Yesterday i did some testing to see what will trigger what and here are my results, in case someone will also need it. (to update docs for example :wink: )

to answer my own question webhook response is always of the same format.

now for the tests, here is the format:
callback -> what i did -> YES/NO (yes means i got response, no means i didnt)

member:update -> old(canceled) patron joins(pledges) -> YES

member:update -> patron removes(cancels) pledge -> YES

member:update -> completely new member pledges -> NOOO

member:update -> patron ± changes pledge -> NO

members:create -> oldPatreon pledges again -> NO

member: create -> completely new member pledges -> YES

members:pledge:update -> existing patron ± pledge -> YES

members:pledge:update -> patron cancels pledge -> NOO

members:pledge:update -> old(canceled) patron pledges -> NO

members:pledge:create -> old user creates new pledges -> YES

members:pledge:delete -> user cancels pledge -> YES BUT still shows amount pre cancel (WTF…ok not wtf useful if you want to keep track of what pledge you just lost)

member:update -> patron follows even not pledging -> YES

member:update -> follower pledges -> YES

////////

in conclusion:

completely new user -> members:create (a)

pledge± -> members:pledge:update (b)

patreon removes pledge(cancels) -> member:update ( c)

parton rejoins -> member:update ( c)

So here you go.
It would be nice to get some confirmation from the dev support team if my findings were correct.7
